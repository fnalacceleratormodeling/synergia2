# Normal form and mapping examples

1. `normal_form.cc` Propagate particles through a nonlinear lattice, write out normal form coordinates.

2. `normal_form.py` Propagate particles through a nonlinear lattice, write out normal form coordinates in Python.

3. `channel_map.cc` Read in lattice file `channel.madx`. Print out nonlinear terms in the one-turn map using trigon.

4. `channel_map.py` Read in lattice file `channel.madx`. Print out nonlinear terms in the one-turn map using trigon.

5. `booster_map.py` Read in a simplified booster lattice in json form from file `booster_init_lattice.json`. Print out nonliner terms in the one-turn map using trigon.
